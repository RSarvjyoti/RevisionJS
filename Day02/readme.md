- Type conversion
  - Explicit (Typecasting) --> Number(val), Boolean(val), parseInt(String, redix), parseFloat(String), String(val), toString().
  - Implicit (Coercion) --> Type coercion in JavaScript is the automatic or implicit conversion of values from one data type to another.
- Tips for Effective Type Identification
     - Use typeof for primitive types: It's great for identifying numbers, strings, booleans, and functions.
     - Use Array.isArray for arrays: Since typeof will return "object" for arrays.
     - Use instanceof for custom objects: It's useful for checking an object against a prototype or class.
     - Use Object.prototype.toString for built-in objects: When you need to differentiate between various object types like Date, RegExp, etc.
- The Edge Cases in Type Identification
     - Arrays: Despite being a specialized kind of object, JavaScript's typeof will simply return "object" for an array.
     - Objects: The typeof will return "object" for any object literal, but this doesn't help to distinguish between different kinds of objects.
     - Null: One of the oldest JavaScript gotchas is that typeof null returns "object", which is misleading.
